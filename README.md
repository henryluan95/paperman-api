# PAPERMAN API

This is a back-up API for my capstone project PAPERMAN. It allows the front-end to send requests for a list of all products and a single product. I created this API using ![Express.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/express.js-%23404d59.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=express&logoColor=%2361DAFB)
![MySQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/mysql-%2300f.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=mysql&logoColor=white)
![NodeJS](https://img.shields.io/badge/node.js-6DA55F?style=for-the-badge&logo=node.js&logoColor=white) and Knex. It applied the MVC architecture. 

The current website is using firebase.
